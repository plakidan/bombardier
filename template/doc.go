Package template documents the way user-defined output templates are
ment to be used.

User-defined templates use Go's text/template package, so you might
want to check its documentation first.
There are a bunch of helper methods available inside a template
besides those described in aforementioned documentation, namely:
	- WithLatencies()
		Tells whether --latencies flag were activated.
	- FormatBinary(numberOfBytes float64) string
		Converts bytes to kilo-, mega-, giga-, etc.- bytes, and
		appends appropriate suffix "KB", "MB", "GB", etc.
	- FormatTimeUs(us float64) string
		Converts microseconds to milliseconds, seconds, minutes or
		hours and appends appropriate suffix.
	- FormatTimeUsUint64(us uint64) string
		Same as above, but for uint64, since type conversions are
		not available in templates.
	- FloatsToArray(ps ...float64) []float64
		Converts a bunch of floats into array, since, again,
		type conversions are not available in templates.
	- Multiply(num, coeff float64) float64
		Arithmetics are not available inside of templates either.
	- StringToBytes(s string) []byte
		Convenience function to convert string to []byte.
	- UUIDV1() (UUID, error)
		Generates UUID Version 1, based on timestamp and
		MAC address (RFC 4122)
	- UUIDV2(domain byte) (UUID, error)
		Generates UUID Version 2, based on timestamp, MAC address
		and POSIX UID/GID (DCE 1.1)
	- UUIDV3(ns UUID, name string) UUID
		Generates UUID Version 3, based on MD5 hashing (RFC 4122)
	- UUIDV4() (UUID, error)
		Generates UUID Version 4, based on random numbers (RFC 4122)
	- UUIDV5(ns UUID, name string) UUID
		Generates UUID Version 5, based on SHA-1 hashing (RFC 4122)

The structure that gets passed to the template is documented in
the package github.com/codesenberg/bombardier/internal. The structure
of interest is TestInfo. It basically consists of Spec and Result
fields, the former contains various information about the test
(number of connections, URL, HTTP method, headers, body, rate, etc.)
performed, while the latter contains results obtained during the
execution of this test (bytes read/written, time taken, RPS, etc.).
